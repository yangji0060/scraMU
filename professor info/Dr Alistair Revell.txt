Dr Alistair Revell  Senior Lecturer, Director of External Affairs  0161-3063762  George Begg Building - C40  alistair.revell@manchester.ac.uk  

BIOGRAPHY: 
Alistair graduated from UMIST in 2002 with a degree in Aerospace Engineering with French, during which time he completed an industrial internship and a research placement at L'Ecole Nationale Suprieure de Mecanique et d'Aerotechnique in France. He received his PhD in Turbulence Modelling and Computational Fluid Dynamics at The University of Manchester in 2006, including time amounting to a year between 2003 and 2004 at l'Institut de Mecanique des Fluides de Toulouse as a Marie Curie Fellow. He has also spent several months at Electricite de France with the development team of the open-source CFD software Code_Saturne and a Summer project at the Center for Turbulence Research, Stanford University. He was appointed as a Lecturer in 2007 following a brief Postdoc position on turbulence induced vibrations in gas pipes. In 2011 he undertook a sabbatical at CIEMAT, Madrid to work on immersed boundary methods. His research spans a broad range of applications, with a focus on turbulence modelling and flow structure interaction, and is actively involved in developing novel software for future computational architectures, in particular GPUs. In the Aerospace sector he has been involved in five EU funded projects which focus upon improving the prediction of turbulence modelling & simulation, and novel strategies for drag reduction. Energy: predictive simulation of pipeline distribution networks & flow around marine current turbines. Bioengineering: Ventricular Assistive Devices, protein manufacturability, software for real-time surgery simulation.
