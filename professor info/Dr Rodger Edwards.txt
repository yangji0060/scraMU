BIOGRAPHY: 
Rodger Edwards gained a BSc in Metals and Materials Technology, an MSc by research and a PhD from the joint Department of Metallurgy, University of Manchester /UMIST.   He became a Research Assistant in the Department of Building, UMIST in 1983, and was appointed to a Lectureship within the Department in 1988. He became a member of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers in 1996, a Chartered Engineer in 1997 and was promoted to Senior Lecturer the same year.
Rodger has authored and co-authored over 100 papers and technical / consultancy reports and is currently supervising / co supervising 5 research students. His main areas of research interest are currently:
Energy conservation
Building performance
Zero emissions buildings
Ventilation, air movement and air quality
At present, Rodger is seconded to the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences (EPS) for 50% of his time, where he fulfils the role of Academic Programme Development Officer. This post carries several key responsibilities, for example Chairman of EPS Appeals, Complaints and Disciplinary Panels and Chairman of EPS Foundation Studies Board.
He is Chair of the University Admission and Qualifications Group and is also a member of the University Teaching and Learning Group.
