BIOGRAPHY: 
Dr Prosser began his engineering career with BNFL. After serving 4 years on a mechanical engineering apprenticeship and two years working on the design of nuclear reprocessing facilities, he left to study for a BEng(Hons) at UMIST. Upon graduation he joined the University of Cambridge, working on his PhD project 'Numerical methods for the computation of combustion', and concentrating on multiresolution (wavelet) methods. After working for two years at Cambridge's CFD laboratory, he joined the school of mechanical engineering at UMIST. He currently teaches thermodynamics, computational fluid dynamics and Design
