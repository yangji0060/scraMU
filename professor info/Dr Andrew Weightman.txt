Dr Andrew Weightman  Lecturer  0161-2754524  Pariser Building - B48  andrew.weightman@manchester.ac.uk  

BIOGRAPHY: 
completed a PhD in 2006 on modelling and controller development for vibration attenuation in smart dynamic structures. After completing my PhD the opportunity arose for me to utilise my research skills, and technical knowledge in control, and apply them to an area that I am passionate about, helping those with cognitive and physical impairments. I have contributed to several multidisciplinary projects (see appointments) working with healthcare professionals, movement psychologists, engineers and those with motor impairments. I have developed specialist skills which bridge the gaps between these disciplines, demonstrated by my appointment as a lecturer in Motor Control (maternity cover), and have laid the foundations for me to fulfil my research potential and contribute in this important area. The quality of my research has been recognised by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence, cited as an example of good user engagement, I was also shortlisted as a finalist in the NHS medipex awards. Furthermore through its dissemination in the Journal of Engineering Design, Best paper of 2010 award, and The Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine, Editors choice of the issue.
