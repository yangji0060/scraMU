Dr Martin Gillie  Reader  0161-2754463  Pariser Building - C19  martin.gillie@manchester.ac.uk  

BIOGRAPHY: 
I am Reader in Structural Engineering with research interests in numerical modelling of structures, structures in fire and sustainability of structures.  My teaching interests are mainly in structural design and engineering problem solving, although I have also taught engineering analysis, engineering maths and specialist courses in structural fire engineering.
Following a degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Edinburgh (1st Class, 1997), I studied the behaviour of the Cardington Structure in fire and obtained my Phd in 2000, also from Edinburgh.  I then spent some time working on silo structures as a researcher before moving to Aberdeen to work in offshore design for Andrew Palmer and Associates.  In 2003 I returned to academia as lecturer at the University of Nottingham before a move back to Edinburgh in 2005.  I was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 2011 and for two and half years was head of Civil Engineering Teaching.  In 2014 I took up my current role as Reader at the University of Manchester.  I am Member of the Institution of Structural Engineeers, a Chartered Engineer and Fellow of the Higher Education Academy.
