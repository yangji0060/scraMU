Dr Conor Walsh  Research Associate  0161-2754332  Pariser Building  conor.walsh@manchester.ac.uk  

BIOGRAPHY: 
Upon completion of his BSc in Environmental Science from the University of Limerick, Conor undertook an MSc in Sustainable Development. His doctoral studies focused on methodological adaptation of a land based sustainability indicator, with specific relevance to Ireland. This included development of a method to incorporate methane into ecological footprinting, as well a tool for comparing the emissions of commuting (including cycling). The later of which was referenced in the Irish Times. Since moving to the University Conor has worked on two different projects, looking at very different sectors, shipping and low grade heat use in process industries. He is currently involved in a consortium project headed by UCL which examines the implciations of differing decarbonisation pathways for the shipping sector.
